# React Static List of TODOs

Created a todo management web app by splitting provided App markup into three components: TodoList, TodoInfo, and UserInfo. Maintained existing CSS class names for testing purposes. TodoList displays todos, TodoInfo shows todo details with a TodoInfo--completed modifier for completed todos, and UserInfo presents user info when available.
